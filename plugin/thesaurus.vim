" Description:
" 	" This is a vim script wrapper for the python plugin which
"	" retrieves the thesaurus of the given requested word from
" 	" the website at www.thesaurus.com. Original idea comes from
	"  Anton Beloglazov <http://beloglazov.info/>
	"  and
	"  Nick Coleman <http://www.nickcoleman.org/>
	" This specific wraper file (2nd half) exposes a handful of
" 	" necessary commands and keymaps to users. Another wrapper
" 	" file (1st half) bridges the graps between python and
" 	" vim script is under autload for efficiency considerations.
